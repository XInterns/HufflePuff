 ## What's it all about?
 A scalable web app to be used in near future for casual bidding in different sports in the Corporate Tournaments. The web app is in its initial phase of development into a complete extensive app. It is currently being build and tested only for CRICKET due to time restrictions and can further be extended for multiple sports in the next development phases.
